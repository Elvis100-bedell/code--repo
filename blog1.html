                <div class="bs-blog-detail">10 February 2014 - 11:32, by <a href="#">Dankov</a>, in <a href="#">Envato</a>, <a href="#">25 comments</a></div>
                <div class="bs-blog-text">Women empowerment mainly refers to the practice of making women independent so that they can take their own decisions as well as handle their lives without any familial or societal restrictions. In simple terms, it entitles women to take charge of their own personal development. Since women have always been the oppressed ones in a patriarchal society, the main motive of women empowerment is to help them stand equally with men. It is a foundational step to ensure the prosperous growth of a family as well as the country. Empowering women, the world would definitely witness gender equality and help women from every stratum of society stand on their own and steer their lives as per their own wishes.  
                  <p>Globally renowned for its culture and heritage, India is a country filled with diverse cultures. But the Indian society has always been a patriarchal one which is why women have been continuously denied basic human rights such as education and equality. They have always been suppressed and limited to domesticity and restrained from getting basic education. The notion of gender equality demands parity between males and females but women have been kept oblivious of their rights. For a country like India, women empowerment will be a greater role in its growth and development.

                    In both biological and moral context, women possess greater abilities to shape the future and development of a family as well as society as a whole. Thus, equal opportunities should be given every women to help them fully grow as an individual and make their own choices. </p><br>
                    <p>Women empowerment encompasses more than just ensuring that women get their basic rights. In its truest form, women empowerment comprises the aspects of independence, equality as well as freedom of expression. Through this, the real strive lies in ensuring that we bring gender equality.

                      When given the right support, women have shone brilliantly in every field. Even in India, we have seen women handle diverse roles, be it a Prime Minister, Astronaut, Entrepreneur, Banker and much more. Further, women are also considered the backbone of a family. From domestic chores to nurturing children, they handle multiple responsibilities. This is why they are great at multitasking and often many working women efficiently juggle between professional and personal responsibilities. While the urban cities have working women, the rural areas have still restrained them to household chores. How can we aspire to prosper as a nation where every girl does not get the access to education or making their own choices? India is a country where we worship goddesses while we don’t bother thinking about gender equality. 

                      
                      Hence, for all our mothers, sisters and daughters we must aim at creating an environment of integrity. We must boost their confidence to make them capable enough to take their decisions in every phase of life and this is how we can strive towards bringing women empowerment.</p>
                      <p>“Feminism does not aim to make women powerful. Women are already powerful. It is about influencing the way the rest of the world views your strength.” Women have always had fewer opportunities and possibilities to develop their talents and knowledge since ancient times. Although the world is made up of both men and women. But men were regarded as the family’s most powerful members. They were the family’s decision-maker and were in charge of making a living. Women, on the other hand, were believed to be the responsible person for all home chores and child-rearing, and they were not engaged in making any important family decisions. The roles were assigned depending on gender. If we look at the whole picture, research shows that women’s subjects are either centered on their reproductive role and their body, or on their economic position as workers. However, none of them are aimed at empowering women. Women’s Empowerment is a progressive technique of putting power in the hands of women in order for them to have a happy and respectable existence in society. Women are empowered when they have access to opportunities in a number of sectors, such as the right to an education, gender equality, a professional (equal wage) lifestyle, and others. However, there are no constraints or limitations. It involves training, awareness, increasing their position via education, literacy, and decision-making authority. For the total growth of each country, women’s empowerment is the most essential sector. Previously, the men were the sole breadwinners in the household. Assume the household has one earning person; on the other side, suppose the family has both males and women earning members. Who will have a better way of life? The answer is simple: a household in which both the man and the woman work. As a result, when gender equality is prioritized, a country’s growth rate accelerates. Standing up for equality, women have empowered and spoken up for other women.</p>
